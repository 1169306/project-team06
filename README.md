- Designed and implemented a Question Answering (QA) system focusing on bio-medical questions based on Apache UIMA Framework, which is also the fundamental tools for IBM Watson Project.
- Retrieved related documents and responded exact answers from PubMed articles using Stanford CoreNLP, LingPipe tools.
- - Built a retrieval system in multiple retrieval approaches such as Vector Space Retrival, and TF-IDF. A complex querying structure has been applied with multiple operators, which enhanced the concept retrieval performance significantly.
- Using different scoring mechanism to analyze the result produced by our system, evaluated and compared the performance of each approach separately and also the performance of all integrative approaches using the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), F-measure, Average Precision, Mean Average Precision, and Geometric Mean Average Precision.
